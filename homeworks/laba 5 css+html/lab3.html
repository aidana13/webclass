    	<h2><b> "folklore" album </b></h2>
    	<p class="bolder">folklore <em>(stylized in all lowercase)</em> is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter <i>Taylor Swift</i>.</p>
    	<p class="normal">It was a surprise album, released through <em>Republic Records on July 24, 2020,</em> eleven months after <i>Swift's</i> last album, <b>Lover (2019)</b>. As <em>an indie folk, alternative rock, electro-folk, and chamber pop album,</em> <b>Folklore</b> marks a departure from the upbeat pop sound of <i>Swift's</i> preceding studio albums to mellow tunes driven by piano and guitar, featuring production from <i>Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff</i>. Written and recorded in isolation during the <em>COVID-19 pandemic</em>, <i>Swift</i> called the album <i>"a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness"</i> rising out of her imagination, manifesting vivid storytelling from largely third-person perspectives that detail introspection and escapism. The singer adopted <em>a rustic, cottagecore aesthetic</em> for the album.</p>
