    	<p><span class="str">Lover</span> is the seventh studio album by <span class="str2">American</span> singer-songwriter <span class="str">Taylor Swift</span>, released on August 23, 2019, through <span class="str2">Republic Records</span>. As the executive producer, <span class="str">Swift</span> enlisted producers <span class="str2">Jack Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little</span> for the album.<br> 
    	Lover is primarily a <span class="word">pop, synth-pop, electropop, and pop rock</span> record with a retro style, encompassing diverse genres such as <span class="word2">country, funk, dream pop, folk, rock and roll, R&B, bubblegum pop, pop punk, and indie pop</span>. Defined by Swift as <span class="word">"a love letter to love itself"</span>.<br> 
    	<span class="copy">Lover celebrates the full spectrum of love, using light and bright tones that depart from the dark nature of its predecessor, Reputation (2017). The album's music videos and art direction marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which embodied a summer aesthetic consisting mostly of pastel colors.</span>
    	<span class="copy2">Lover contains collaborations with Brendon Urie and The Dixie Chicks. It was preceded by three singles, all of which entered the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100: "Me!" and "You Need to Calm Down" peaked at number two, while the title track reached number 10. Breaking a string of records, all 18 tracks of Lover charted simultaneously on the Hot 100, including "The Man" which peaked at number 23 and later became the fourth single.</span></p>
